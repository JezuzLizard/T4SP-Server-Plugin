# T4SP-Server-Plugin
A plugin that has code that hopefully compiles and the game will load it to do things. Stability not guaranteed.

Requires Git (https://git-scm.com/), Premake5 (https://premake.github.io/), and MSVC 2022 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) to build.

# What does it do?
Nothing really right now, just detours and reimplements the entire GSC VM, for research purposes.

# Installation
Move the `t4sp-server-plugin.dll` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plutonium\storage\t4\plugins\`, the plugin will be loaded when you start up a dedicated server for Plutonium T4SP.
